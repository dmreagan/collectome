# Collectome frontend

## Install development dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Run development server

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Licensing

You can automatically inject copyright and license info into the source files using the `license` script. Just edit the _LICENSE_ file to have the proper year, then run:

```bash
npm run license
```

Note: this script will inject license information into files in all directories under _collectome_, not just _frontend_.
